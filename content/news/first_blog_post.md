⏰Data collection for the Transatlantic Privacy Perceptions survey is halfway through. 
As a privacy expert, your insights into the #AI tools and frameworks your organization/company is currently using, as well as the #governance and #privacy structures in place, are invaluable. Your participation will provide essential data that helps shape the dialogue on AI governance and privacy on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Please, do not delay your participation. Your contribution is vital, and together, we will make a significant impact.

⏱The survey will only take 2-5 minutes of your time.
