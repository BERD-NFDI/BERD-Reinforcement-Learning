TAPP’s methodology, designed by survey and sampling experts from University of Maryland, USA (UMD) and LMU Munich, Germany, is developed to gather the most robust and insightful data in the field of AI and digital privacy research.

Our survey is a quantitative online questionnaire designed to gather insights on privacy and AI-related issues. It includes single/ multiple-choice and open-ended questions takes just 5 minutes to complete. 

We welcome participation from anyone who is actively engaged in the AI and privacy debate. This includes those active in (social) media, professional events, and members of professional privacy networks like the IAPP. We are interested in hearing from professionals, volunteers, and activists working on AI and privacy issues. 

We prescreen participants to make sure our sample consists of field experts. The survey is anonymous, and results will be shared in aggregate (open-ended answers will be categorized before sharing). Only certified researchers have access to individual data points.
