{{ anchor(title="Methodology")}}
{% block_2c(title="Methodology" left_text="TAPP’s methodology, designed by survey and sampling experts from University of Maryland, USA (UMD) and LMU Munich, Germany, is developed to gather the most robust and insightful data in the field of AI and digital privacy research." bg="white")%}

Our survey is a quantitative online questionnaire designed to gather insights on privacy and AI-related issues. It includes both single and multiple-choice as well as open-ended questions and typically takes just 5 minutes to complete. 

We welcome participation from anyone who is actively engaged in the AI and privacy debate. This includes those active in (social) media, professional events, and members of professional privacy networks like the IAPP. We are interested in hearing from professionals, volunteers, and activists working on AI and privacy issues. Our respondents come from diverse backgrounds such as industry, NGOs, media, government, law, and academia. 

We prescreen participants to make sure our sample consists of field experts. Participation in the survey is anonymous. We will share the results in the aggregated form (open-ended answers will be categorized before sharing). Only the research team members, who are officially certified in research ethics, have access to the individual data points.
