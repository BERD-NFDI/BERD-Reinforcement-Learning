 We provide survey infrastructure and methodology knowledge to give experts opportunities to raise awareness about the privacy issues they care about, thereby contributing to public debate and enhancing scientific research that can improve policymaking and technological design.
  

Initiated in 2022, TAPP has completed five waves of quantitative surveys, a round of in-depth interviews, and is preparing to go into the field with wave 6 in 2024. With increasing interest in the survey and growing participation rates, we aim to expand our research scope to include regions with emerging privacy debates, such as Africa and Latin America.
