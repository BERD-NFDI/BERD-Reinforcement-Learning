{% block_2c(bg="white" left_text="Overview") %}**How do machines learn to make the right choices? How can individuals, firms, organizations, and researchers use automated decision-making?** 

 This course provides an introduction and intuition for designing algorithms that allow machines to learn based on reinforcements. Reinforcement learning provides decision rules based on learning from partial, implicit, and delayed feedback.


This is particularly useful in sequential decision-making tasks where a machine repeatedly interacts with the environment or users. Reinforcement learning is well known for its successes in robotic control, autonomous vehicles, game playing, and chat agents. In business, economics, and the social sciences, there is a recent explosion of applications including temporal difference learning and adaptive experiments.
